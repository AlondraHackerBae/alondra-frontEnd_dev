    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from Houston, Tx</h3>

    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p class="mt-5">
        As an entry level software developer transitioning from a career in
        hospitality, I bring years of adaptability, problem-solving, and customer
        service experience to the tech industry. Ambitious and eager to learn,
        Iâ€™m diving into coding with the same dedication and enthusiasm that
        defined my success in beverage management. I'm ready to tackle challenges and grow
        in this inspiring new field.
        <br />
        <br />
        I honed my skills through a self-paced online coding bootcamp, where I developed
         a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and API integration. Self-motivated 
         and a quick learner, I thrive on approaching new obstacles and continuously improving
          my craft. I'm thrilled to bring my passion, creativity, and problem-solving 
          abilities to a team and contribute to building impactful digital solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
      
       Progressing into tech as an African American woman holds deep personal 
       significance, as it represents not only my own growth but also the importance 
       of diversity and representation in the field. By stepping into this space, 
       I aim to break barriers and challenge stereotypes, proving that women of all 
       backgrounds belong in tech. My journey serves as a testament to the potential
        for future generations of women of color to see themselves in these roles, 
        inspiring and paving the way for others to follow with confidence and determination. 
        <br />
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
        With a passion for creating beautiful, user-centric websites and
        applications, Iâ€™m eager to contribute to projects that make a real
        impact. The tech industry is evolving, and I see myself not just coding,
        but also shaping the digital experiences of tomorrow. As I continue to
        learn, grow, and connect with other developers, Iâ€™m excited to embrace
        opportunities in leadership, innovation, and mentorship. I believe the
        future holds great things, from mastering new technologies to inspiring
        other women to pursue their own paths in tech. The best is yet to come!
